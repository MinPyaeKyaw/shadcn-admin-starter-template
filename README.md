# React.js Admin Portal Starter Template Documentation

## Overview

This starter template is designed for building a modern React.js dashboard application. It includes essential features like authentication, data fetching, table display, charting, localization, and more. Itâ€™s fully responsive and supports both light and dark themes. Below are detailed descriptions of the features and their integrations.

## Features

### 1. API Integration using Axios and TanStack Query

- **Axios** is used for making HTTP requests to interact with external APIs, providing robust error handling and request/response transformations.
- **TanStack Query** (React Query) is used for data fetching, caching, synchronization, and background updates. This ensures that the app stays in sync with server data without redundant re-fetching.

### 2. Data Table using TanStack Table

- A highly customizable and performant data table is integrated using **TanStack Table**.
- Features include pagination, sorting, filtering, and flexible layouts to accommodate various types of data.

### 3. Form Integration and Validation using React Hook Form and Zod

- Form handling is managed by **React Hook Form**, which offers seamless validation, error handling, and state management for form inputs.
- **Zod** is used for form validation schemas, ensuring the form data adheres to strict types and structures.
- Together, they provide a robust solution for managing form state and ensuring the correctness of user input.

### 4. Modal and Toast Notifications

- **Modal** windows are used for displaying overlays, confirmations, or additional information without leaving the current page.
- **Toast notifications** provide feedback to users for actions like form submission success or API errors, ensuring a better user experience.

### 5. Charts

- The template supports visual data representation using charts. **Chart.js** or a similar charting library is used to display data in various formats (bar charts, line charts, etc.), making the dashboard informative and engaging.

### 6. Localization (i18n)

- The template includes localization support for translating the app into multiple languages.
- **react-i18next** or similar libraries are used for internationalization, allowing easy switching between different languages based on user preferences.

### 7. Idle State Detection

- The template incorporates idle state detection, monitoring user activity and determining periods of inactivity.
- Using event listeners for mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and touch events, it efficiently tracks user presence, enabling actions like session timeouts or notifications after extended idle periods.

### 8. Dark Mode and Light Mode

- Users can toggle between light and dark themes.
- **CSS variables** or **Styled Components** are used to manage theming, ensuring that the UI adapts dynamically without requiring page reloads.

### 9. UI for Error Pages

- The app includes custom-designed **error pages** (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
- These error pages guide users back to the main app and provide useful context, improving the user experience even in failure scenarios.

### 10. Responsive Design

- The template is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** are employed to ensure the layout adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes.

### 11. Sidebar and Header for Dashboard Layout

- A sidebar navigation component is integrated to allow quick access to various sections of the dashboard.
- The **header** includes essential user interactions like profile access, notifications, theme toggles, and logout options.
- Both sidebar and header are responsive and adjust according to the screen size and user preferences.
